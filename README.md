# 💁🏾‍♀️ Demi Fashemo Portfolio Website

## Overview
This is the website for my virtual portfolio! It features my work experience, past projects, a more in-depth personal introduction, and more!

## Artifical Intelligence
The initial formatting of this site was heavily generated using Claude AI. I ran the Claude coding assistant program in my project directory, uploaded my resume, and prompted it to initialize an html template based off of my resume data. Then, I made the remaining edits/personalization manually and deployed my site to GitHub pages!
