                    <p>Hello! My name is Obademilade (Oh-bah-deh-mee-lah-deh), but you can call me 'Demi' for short! I am currently in my third year studying Networked and Social Systems Engineering (NETS) at the University of Pennsylvania (such a mouthful, I know!). NETS is a specialized degree program at Penn that combines Computer Science, Economics, and Network Theory. Its interdisciplinary nature has allowed me to build a strong technical skill foundation, while simultaneously deepening my understanding of how technology can be applied to different socioneconomic networks/markets.</p>
                    <p>While my coursework is diverse, its content remains cohesive. I hope to leverage my education into a career at the intersection of Business and Technology. Whether that be as a Fullstack Engineer, Data Analyst, or Consultant, I'm not exactly sure. But I've come to realize that it's more about the purpose of the work that I complete than the exact role I play in completing it that matters to me. My passion for Computer Science stems from my strong belief that technology can be leveraged to do a lot of good in this world. And I hope that in whichever career role I end up in long-term, I get to do just that.</p>
